## External Flash Memory

The PCB contains external flash memory devices identified as **Macronix MX25R8035F**.

Package marking:

```text
R80X
250AV
```

Identification was confirmed using a CH341A programmer and NeoProgrammer.

### Specifications

- Manufacturer: Macronix
- Part Number: MX25R8035F
- Capacity: 8 Mbit (1 MB)
- Interface: SPI / Dual SPI / Quad SPI
- Supply Voltage: 1.65 V – 3.6 V

MX25R8035F devices are populated on the PCB, providing a total of **1 MB** of external non-volatile storage.

## SWD Access

Connection tested using:

- Raspberry Pi Pico
- Free-DAP CMSIS-DAP firmware
- OpenOCD 0.12

OpenOCD successfully detected the ARM Debug Port:

```text
SWD DPIDR 0x2BA01477
```

## Protection

The device is protected using Nordic APPROTECT.

OpenOCD output:

```text
nRF52 device has AP lock engaged (see UICR APPROTECT register).
Debug access is denied.
Use 'nrf52_recover' to erase and unlock the device.
```

This means that SWD communication works correctly, but firmware readout and debugging are blocked until a full chip erase is performed.
